# KeywordFinder
A Python Program design to find the number of occurrences of keywords in a given text 

Project started: September 26th, 2019

Goal: To read a student's essay response and find how many times they used specific keywords pre-determined by an instructor. These keywords are to be grouped into a number of groups and the student must use keywords from each group X number of times for the essay response to be acceptable.

Update - Version 1.1 - Oct, 5th, 2019:

Added user input functionality for selction of keywords
This is done using Python's built-in input() function.
The user can now enter how many keyword categories they would like and then the corresponding keywords for each of those categories.
At each point the user enters something, the input is reprinted on the screen and the program confirms it is correct.
Text to be analyzed is still read from text file.
